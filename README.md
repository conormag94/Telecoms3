Telecoms Assignment 3 - Distributed Systems Application

Java Version
============
Make sure you use java 1.8.

tcdIO.jar
=====

tcdIO.jar was added as external jar from my computer.
When you check out the code it expects it to be in C://Users/Conor/project/lib on my computer.
So just remove it and add it in again yourself in your lib folder on your own computer.
I've added it to the gitignore file so it shouldn't try to commit it if you make changes
